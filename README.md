I am planning to create simple game using:
- Backend
    - Python with Flask
    - SQLite for database
- Frontend
    - React
    - Axios for API requests
    - Tailwind to speed up styling
- Deployment
    - Docker
- Testing
    - pytest 

I have already prepared development environment before starting this test, that means I have Python, node.js and docker installed on my machine. I am using VSCode for this build. I am using virtual environment for Python -> `/tictactoe` that has been excluded in `.gitignore`.
